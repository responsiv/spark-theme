> **Note**: This project is a work in progress.

October Sparky is a clone of Laravel Spark. This version offers more robust features with no external dependencies to manage plans, such as Stripe or Braintree. It also shares the spirit of October and is simplistic and easy to understand.

Some key differences:

- Teams are not supported out of the box
- jQuery is used instead of Vue.js
